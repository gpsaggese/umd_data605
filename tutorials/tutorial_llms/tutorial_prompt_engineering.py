Abstract: The Internet has become a primary resource for the general public who
seek health information about a variety of topics, including breast cancer.
This particular research is part of a larger study which evaluated the use of
basic design tenets and theoretical behavioral change components in the top 157
breast cancer websites. Fourteen components were taken from three behavioral
change theories. The focus of this particular project was to assess the use of
these 14 theoretical components on breast cancer websites as they persuade
users towards prevention or detection behaviors. It will also discuss how some
of these components were additionally used to persuade users to contribute
money to the organizations that sponsor the websites. It should first be noted
that overall, theoretical components were absent from the websites in general.
Nine out of the 14 components were found to be used primarily for detection, as
opposed to prevention. This is an important finding because it is just as
valuable, if not more so, for a person to prevent a disease as it is to detect
it early. Four of the 14 were considered when assessing persuasion in terms of
fundraising. Of these four that were assessed, three were used more than 50% of
the time when soliciting money. These results lend ideas for future research on
such topics as well as ideas to better the current state of the top breast
cancer websites.
