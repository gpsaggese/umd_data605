# Set-up environment

- Read carefully the instructions in the top-level `README.md` to clone the class
  repo `umd_data605` and set up an environment using Docker
- Make sure `Docker` daemon is running on your computer (e.g., Docker Desktop for
  Mac)
  - See https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop for more information about
    installation

- Open a terminal

- Go to the dir with the class repo `umd_data605`
  ```
  # E.g., GIT_ROOT=~/src/umd_data605
  > cd $GIT_ROOT
  > ls
  Dockerfile    LICENSE       README.md     __pycache__   dev_scripts   docker_common gp            lectures      tutorial

  > cd tutorials/tutorial_postgres
  > ls
  Dockerfile                    bashrc                        docker_clean.sh               install_jupyter_extensions.sh run_psql_server.sh            tutorial_seven_dbs
  OLD                           docker_bash.sh                docker_push.sh                pg_hba.conf                   tmp.build                     tutorial_university
  README.md                     docker_build.sh               etc_sudoers                   postgresql.conf               tutorial_basics
  ```

## Build container (optional)

- The provided scripts (e.g., `docker_bash.sh`) can use the Docker Hub version of
  the container, but if you are adventurous you can build the container yourself

- Let's look at how the container is built and handled:
   ```
  > cd $GIT_REPO/tutorials/tutorial_postgres
  > vi Dockerfile docker_*.sh
  ```

- Build the Docker container (this takes 10 mins):
  ```
  > docker_build.sh
  ```

## Run container

- Let's look at `docker_bash.sh`, which runs a container
- Run bash inside Docker container
  ```
  > docker_bash.sh
  ```

- You should see the prompt from `Docker` with user and container id
  ```
  postgres@09913bf19d81:/$
  ```
- Check that you can see the host computed dir mounted on Docker `filesystem`
  ```
  docker> ls /data
  Dockerfile  README.md  docker_bash.sh   docker_clean.sh  etc_sudoers
  pg_hba.conf      run_psql_server.sh  tutorial_basics     tutorial_university
  ...
  ``` 
- You should see from inside the container the same files as in
  `tutorial/tutorial_postgres` because we are mapping that directory into Docker
  `/data`, since the command is like:
  ```
  docker run ... -v /Users/saggese/src/umd_data605/tutorials/tutorial_postgres:/data
  ```

## PostgreSQL

- PostgreSQL is a full-fledged and powerful relational database system, and will
  be used for several tutorials and for the class project

- PostgreSQL is already installed in your container
  - These instructions are for you to understand the setup
  - Assuming you have the docker image running, you don't need to do any of this

- PostgreSQL runs in client-server mode
  - The server is a continuously running process that listens on a specific port
    (the actual port can differ and you can usually choose it when starting the
    server)
  - In order to connect to the server, the client needs to know the port
  - The client and server are often on different machines, but in your set-up
    they are on the same machine

- Connecting using the `psql` client is the easiest way to talk to PostgreSQL
  server
  - It provides a command-line access to the database
  - There are other clients too, including GUIs

- PostgreSQL server has a default superuser called `postgres`
  - You can do everything under that username, or you can create a different
    username for yourself
  - If you run a command (say `createdb`) without any options, it uses the same
    Linux username that you are logged in under (i.e., `root`, `postgres`)
  - However, if you haven't created a PostgreSQL user with that name, the command
    will fail. You can either create a user (by logging in as the superuser), or
    run everything as a superuser (typically with the option: `-U postgres`)

- Following steps will get you started with creating a database and populating it
  with the `University` dataset provided on the book website:
  http://www.db-book.com

- `psql` takes quite a few other options: you can specify different user, a
  specific port, another server etc. See
  documentation: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html

- Note: you don't need a password here because PostgreSQL uses what's
  called `peer authentication` by default. You would typically need a password for
  other types of connections to the server (e.g., through JDBC).

## Start Postgres

- We need to start the Postgres DB service / server

- Check out `/data/run_psql_server.sh`
  ```
  docker> vi /data/run_psql_server.sh
  service --status-all
  /etc/init.d/postgresql start
  service --status-all
  ```
  
- Start the PostgresSQL DB service
  ```
  docker> /data/run_psql_server.sh
  + service --status-all
  [ - ]  cron
  [ ? ]  hwclock.sh
  [ - ]  postgresql
  [ - ]  procps
  [ - ]  sysstat
  + /etc/init.d/postgresql start
  * Starting PostgreSQL 14 database server [ OK ]
  + service --status-all
  [ - ]  cron
  [ ? ]  hwclock.sh
  [ + ]  postgresql
  [ - ]  procps
  [ - ]  sysstat
  ```

## Connecting to Postgres
  
- You can connect to `Postgres` server:
  - from your laptop (outside Docker) like a regular client would do
  - from another process inside Docker
  - from Jupyter notebook

### Connecting to Postgres from inside the container

- Assuming you have the server running in the `umd_data605_postgres` container

- You can connect to the Postgres server from inside the container either in the
  same that is running the process that started the server
  ```
  > docker_bash.sh
  ```
- Inside the container, start the server in background and then connect to the
  server
  ```
  docker> /data/run_psql_server.sh
  ...
  docker> psql
  psql (14.5 (Ubuntu 14.5-0ubuntu0.22.04.1))
  Type "help" for help.

  postgres=# \c university
  connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: FATAL:  database "university" does not exist
  Previous connection kept
  ```
- The DB is empty so nothing is returned

- Another approach is to open multiple terminals in the same container
  ```
  > docker_bash.sh
  # Start the server.
  ...
  ```

- In another terminal start another process in the same container
  ```
  > docker_exec.sh
  FULL_IMAGE_NAME=gpsaggese/umd_data605_postgres
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                            NAMES
  2ea21580ffb9   gpsaggese/umd_data605_postgres   "bash"    5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8888->8888/tcp   umd_data605_postgres
  CONTAINER_ID=2ea21580ffb9
  postgres@2ea21580ffb9:/$
  ```

### Connecting to Postgres from your laptop

- From your laptop terminal (outside `Docker`) you need to install the Postgres
  client `psql` to connect
  ```
  > brew install postgresql
  > psql -U postgres -h localhost
  SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
  You are now connected to database "university" as user "postgres".

  postgres=# 
  ```
- This is equivalent to running from inside the container

- It shows how the connection happens over a port from client and server
  - Processes are running on separate "machines", one is Docker, the other is
    your laptop

### Connecting to Postgres from Jupyter notebook

- From inside the container
  ```
  docker> /data/run_jupyter_postgres.sh
  ```
- From your local computer go to `localhost:8888` in the browser

- Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/tree/data/tutorial_university`

- Execute the 3 tutorials
  ```
  > ls -1 *.ipynb
  sql_basics.ipynb
  sql_joins.ipynb
  sql_nulls_and_unknown.ipynb
  ```

- Note that you need to initialize the DB with some content to run the notebooks
  (see below)

- The notebook connects to your local PostgreSQL instance and serves as an
  alternative mechanism to run queries

- We can now run SQL commands using `magic` commands, which is an extensibility
  mechanism provided by Jupyter.
  - `%sql` is for single-line SQL commands
  - `%%sql` allows us to do multi-line SQL commands

## Creating example database

### Creating small university example databases

- Assume that the DB server is already running
  ```
  > cd tutorials/tutorial_postgres
  > docker_bash.sh
  FULL_IMAGE_NAME=gpsaggese/umd_data605_postgres
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                            NAMES
2ea21580ffb9   gpsaggese/umd_data605_postgres   "bash"    5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8888->8888/tcp   umd_data605_postgres
CONTAINER_ID=2ea21580ffb9
  docker> more /data/tutorial_university/init_small_psql_university_db.sh
  #!/bin/bash -xe

  createdb university
  psql --command "\i /data/tutorial_university/DDL.sql;" university
  psql --command "\i /data/tutorial_university/smallRelationsInsertFile.sql;" university
  ```
- Look at the script creating the schema
  ```
  docker> more /data/tutorial_university/DDL.sql
  ...
  ```

- Look at the script inserting the data
  ```
  docker> more /data/tutorial_university/smallRelationsInsertFile.sql
  ...
  ```

- We can populate the `university DB` running the script inside Docker:
  ```
  docker> /data/tutorial_university/init_small_psql_university_db.sh
  + createdb university
  + psql --command '\i /data/tutorial_university/DDL.sql;' university
  psql:/data/tutorial_university/DDL.sql:1: NOTICE:  table "prereq" does not exist, skipping
  DROP TABLE
  ...
  ```

- The script executes the following commands:

- Create a database called `university`:
  ```
  psql> createdb university
  ```

- Create the tables
  ```
  psql> \i DDL.sql
  ```

- To populate the database using the provided university dataset, use the
  ```
  psql> \i smallRelationsInsertFile.sql
  ``` 

- For this to work, the two `.sql` files must be in the same directory as the one
  where you started `psql`.

### Creating "university_large" example

- You can create a different database `university_large` for the larger dataset provided
- Since the table names are identical, you need a separate database

## Using psql CLI

- Now you have the postgres prompt and the client can send commands to the server

- `psql` program has a number of internal commands that are not SQL commands; such
  commands are often client and database specific. For psql, they begin with the
  backslash character: `\`
- For example, you can get help on the syntax of various PostgreSQL SQL commands
  by typing: `\h`.

- `\d`: lists out the tables in the database.

- All commands like this can be found
  at: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html.
- `\?` will also list them out

- You can ask for help
  ```
  postgres=# help
  You are using psql, the command-line interface to PostgreSQL.
  Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
  \h for help with SQL commands
  \? for help with psql commands
  \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
  \q to quit
  ```

- Get help for DB admin commands

  postgres=# \?
  General
  \copyright             show PostgreSQL usage and distribution terms
  \crosstabview [COLUMNS] execute query and display results in crosstab
  \errverbose            show most recent error message at maximum verbosity
  \g [(OPTIONS)] [FILE]  execute query (and send results to file or |pipe);
  ```

- Get help for SQL commands
  ```
  postgres=# \h
  Available help:
    ABORT                            ALTER SYSTEM                     CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER      CREATE USER MAPPING              DROP ROUTINE                     PREPARE
    ALTER AGGREGATE                  ALTER TABLE                      CREATE FOREIGN TABLE             CREATE VIEW                      DROP RULE                        PREPARE TRANSACTION
  ...
  ```

- Get help for a specific SQL command
  ```
  postgres=# \h create
  Command:     CREATE ACCESS METHOD
  Description: define a new access method
  Syntax:
  CREATE ACCESS METHOD name
      TYPE access_method_type
      HANDLER handler_function
  ```

- Show which databases are available
  ```
  postgres=# \l
                                   List of databases
         Name       |  Owner   | Encoding | Collate |  Ctype  |   Access privileges
  ------------------+----------+----------+---------+---------+-----------------------
   large_university | postgres | UTF8     | C.UTF-8 | C.UTF-8 |
   postgres         | postgres | UTF8     | C.UTF-8 | C.UTF-8 |
   template0        | postgres | UTF8     | C.UTF-8 | C.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
                    |          |          |         |         | postgres=CTc/postgres
   template1        | postgres | UTF8     | C.UTF-8 | C.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
                    |          |          |         |         | postgres=CTc/postgres
   university       | postgres | UTF8     | C.UTF-8 | C.UTF-8 |
  (5 rows)
  ```

- After the server has started, PostgreSQL automatically creates one database for its
  own purpose, called `postgres`
  for your data. Here are more details on **createdb**:


- Connect to the `university` DB (which contains the `University` dataset provided
  on the book website: http://www.db-book.com)
- Note that the prompt changes to show which DB you are connected to:
  ```
  postgres=# \c university
  SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
  You are now connected to database "university" as user "postgres".
  
  university=#
  ```

- List the available tables (aka relations):
  ```
  university=# \d
             List of relations
   Schema |    Name    | Type  |  Owner
  --------+------------+-------+----------
   public | advisor    | table | postgres
   public | classroom  | table | postgres
   public | course     | table | postgres
   public | department | table | postgres
   public | instructor | table | postgres
   public | prereq     | table | postgres
   public | section    | table | postgres
   public | student    | table | postgres
   public | takes      | table | postgres
   public | teaches    | table | postgres
   public | time_slot  | table | postgres
  (11 rows)
  ```

- Show the content of one table:
  ```
  university=# select * from instructor;
    id   |    name    | dept_name  |  salary
  -------+------------+------------+----------
